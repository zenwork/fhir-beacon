# Reference

A CodeableConcept represents a value that is usually supplied by providing a reference to one or more terminologies or ontologies but may also be defined by the provision of text. This is a common pattern in healthcare data.

reference:
* [2.1.3.0 Resource References (R5)](http://hl7.org/fhir/R5/references.html)
* [2.1.3.0.1 Reference (R5)](http://hl7.org/fhir/R5/references.html#reference)

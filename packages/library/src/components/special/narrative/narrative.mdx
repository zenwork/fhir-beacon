# Special Cases

This resource is primarily used for the identification and definition of a medication, including ingredients, for the purposes of prescribing, dispensing, and administering a medication as well as for making statements about medication use.


## Narrative
reference: [R5](http://hl7.org/fhir/R5/narrative.html#2.1.4.0)

the `fhir-narrative` component uses light-DOM so allows css formatting of the content form outside.

### In display mode
<Canvas of={Stories.DisplayMode} />


### In narrative mode
<Canvas of={Stories.NarrativeMode} />

### Overriding the Narrative Styling
This styling is accomplished by setting a stylesheet in the page head that will be picked up by the `fhir-narrative`
element and only applied to the narrative HTML. Here is an example

```html
<style id="fhir-beacon-narrative">
  /**
   * Overrides styles to to change the appearance of 3rd-party narrative html.
   * Setting id="fhir-beacon-narrative" above and top level class of #formatted-narrative is necessary to localise styles.
   * The exact styling depends on the provided narrative
   */
  #formatted-narrative {
    font-size: 1rem;
    font-family: sans-serif;
    border: 0.1rem solid gray;
    border-radius: 10px;
    margin: 1rem;
    padding: 1rem;

    div,div[xmlns] {
      all: unset;
      display: inline-block;
      background:unset !important;
      width: fit-content;

      div,td,p,span {
        background: unset !important;
        border:unset !important;
        line-height: 1.5rem;
      }

      }
      h1,h2,h3 {

      }
      td {
        border-left: 0.1rem solid gray;
      }
    }
  }

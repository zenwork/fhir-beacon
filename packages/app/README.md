# FHIR Beacon Showcase App 

[go to the app:](https://fhir-beacon-app.deno.dev)

The showcase is for exploring the integration of the library with use-cases. It currently provides two similar
features for simply displaying resources. In one case it allows loading files from a local filesystem. This feature
only works in browsers that support it (mostly desktop). The other is a simple http client that currently only
supports GET requests. There is a set of demo calls that connect to the HAPI FHIR test server.

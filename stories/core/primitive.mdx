## Primitives

The `<fhir-primitive>` is core element of this library. It combines formatting elements with FHIR logic required by
primitive types to validate and show errors when values are incorrect. It also provides many compositional features
to inrich these primitives with contextual information often found elsewhere in resources.

### Future Work
The `<fhir-primitive>` will eventually also provide an editing/input mde

<Canvas of={Stories.Primary}/>


## Label
`<fhir-label>`
<Canvas of={Stories.Label}/>

## Value
`<fhir-value>`
<Canvas of={Stories.Value}/>

## Error
`<fhir-error>`
<Canvas of={Stories.Error}/>


## Context
`<fhir-context>`
<Canvas of={Stories.Context}/>

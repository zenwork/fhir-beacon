# Custom Rendering

`fhir-beacon` components can be combined with plain html or even other layout components to accomplish complex designs.

Steps to follow:
* Define an overriding `<template></template>`
* bind the template to the fhir component with a unique name using the `name` attribute. This allows managing multiple templates.
* Add elements in the template that support `fhir-beacon`'s data binding mechanism. This can be done by extending
* use the `data-path` attribute to specify the data  with JSONpath (maybe should be FHIRPath) to request a data context gets applied to a component. this overrides the `data` path
* use CSS custom properties and `:part()` query selectors to apply theming that can peirces through the components shadow dom

# Custom Rendering

`fhir-beacon` components can be combined with plain html or even other layout components to accomplish complex designs.

Steps to follow:
* define an overriding template
* bind it to the component by name
* use the `data-path` with JSONpath (maybe should be FHIRPath) to request a data context gets applied to a component. this overrides the `data` path
* use CSS custom properties and `:part()` query selectors to apply theming that can peirces through the components shadow dom

<Canvas of={Stories.Display} layout={'centered'} sourceState={'shown'} />

### The Markup

Add the `fhir-beacon.js` library to your project and start using the new html elements. This works in static html,
frameworks like react and angular, server side rendered html like NextJs, Springboot, and PHP, just to name a few.

```html
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <title>My FHIR App</title>
  <script src="/js/fhir-beacon.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <fhir-medication label="Patient's Medication" data="{...}">
  </fhir-medication>
</body>
</html>
```

### What is rendered
Use these controls to dynamiclly modify what is being displayed:
<Controls of={Stories.FrontPageDemo} exclude={'data'}/>

The components contain all the FHIR logic needed to render the useful information and errors but also to enable insight.
<Canvas of={Stories.FrontPageDemo} layout={'centered'} sourceState={'none'}/>

What Problems Does `fhir-beacon` Solve?
-----
* Build FHIR-based UIs in an idiomatic way that aligns to the standard
* Out-of-the-box rendering of resources, complex, simple, and other FHIR data structures
* Out-of-the-box support for
* narratives (STARETD)
* summaries (STARTED)
* extensions (TODO)
* contains (STARTED)
* lookup remote reference (TODO)
* Display FHIR validation errors
* Display data in user-friendly format
* Display detailed FHIR models
* \[STARTED] Extend components to customize what and how it is rendered
* \[TODO] Theme your UIs with Shoelace theme support
* \[STARTED] Create your own html elements to support you own FHIR extensions or to support custom layouts
* \[TODO] edit data with forms and full validation
* \[TODO] display collections as tables.


Why Use Web Components?
--------------

Web Components are a way to instruct the browser on the introduction of new custom elements that can be used just
like any other HTML markup.

### A Browser Standard

Web component is a browser standard supported in all major browsers and one implementation can be used in all major
frameworks.

They are made up of the following Browser APIs:
* Custom Elements
* Shodow DOM
* Template Elements
* CSS custom properties
* CSS Parts

### Libraries

Although no extra library is needed to create or interact with a web component, there are many librairies that make
their development much easier. This UI toolkit leans masively on Lit and on Shoelace.

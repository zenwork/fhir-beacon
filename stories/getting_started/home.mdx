What Problems Does `fhir-beacon` Solve?
-----
* Build FHIR-based UIs in an idiomatic way that aligns to the standard
* Provide out-of-the-box rendering of resources, complex, simple, and other FHIR data structures
* Display errors
* Render as detailed structures
* Extend components to customize what is rendered
* \[TODO] - edit data with full validation
* \[TODO] - display collections as tables.


Why Use Web Components?
--------------

Web Components are a way to instruct the browser on the introduction of new custom elements that can be used just
like any other HTML markup.

### The Markup

```html
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <title>My FHIR App</title>
  <script src="/js/fhir-beacon.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <fhir-medication label="Patient's Medication" data="{...}">
  </fhir-medication>
</body>
</html>
```

### What is rendered
<Controls of={Stories.Med0319Display} exclude={'data'} />
<Canvas of={Stories.Med0319Display} layout={'centered'} sourceState={'none'} />


### A Browser Standard

Web component is a browser standard supported in all major browsers and one implementation can be used in all major
frameworks.

They are made up of the following Browser APIs:
* Custom Elements
* Shodow DOM
* Template Elements
* CSS custom properties
* CSS Parts

### Libraries

Although no extra library is needed to create or interact with a web component, there are many librairies that make
their development much easier. This UI toolkit leans masively on Lit and on Shoelace.


### Resources

#### dependencies
* [Lit Library](https://lit.dev) - most popular library for implenting web components
* [Shoelace](https://shoelace.style/) - A great UI library built with web components

# Special Cases

This resource is primarily used for the identification and definition of a medication, including ingredients, for the purposes of prescribing, dispensing, and administering a medication as well as for making statements about medication use.


## Narrative
reference: [R5](http://hl7.org/fhir/R5/narrative.html#2.1.4.0)

the `fhir-narrative` component uses light-DOM so allows css formatting of the content form outside.

TODO: There may be a case for a shadow-DOM and light-DOM version to support cases when we don't want unpredicatable
narrative html to inherit styles.

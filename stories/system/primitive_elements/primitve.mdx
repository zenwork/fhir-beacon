# Primitive Element

The `<fhir-primitive>` is core element of this library. It combines formatting elements with the FHIR logic required by
primitive types to validate and show errors when values are incorrect. It also provides many compositional features
to inrich these primitives with contextual information often found elsewhere in resources.

### Validated Primitive Value
<Canvas of={Stories.Simple} sourceState="shown" layout="centered" />

### Display Context
<Canvas of={Stories.WithContext} sourceState="shown" layout="centered" />

### Displaying The Error
<Canvas of={Stories.Dynamic} sourceState="shown" layout="centered" />

### Composing your own
<Canvas of={Stories.Static} sourceState="shown" layout="centered" />

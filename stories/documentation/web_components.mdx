Web Components
==============

Usage
-----

Web Components are a way to instruct the browser on the introduction of new custom elements that can be used just
like any other HTML markup.

```html
<html>
<head>
  <script src="/js/my-element.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <my-element title="Salutation" value="Hello World!"></my-element>
</body>
</html>
```

A Browser Standard
------------------

Web component is a browser standard supported in all major browsers and one implementation can be used in all major
frameworks.

They are made up of the following Browser APIs:
* Custom Elements
* Shodow DOM
* Template Elements
* CSS custom properties
* CSS Parts

Libraries

Although no extra library is needed to create or interact with a web component, there are many librairies that make
their development easier.

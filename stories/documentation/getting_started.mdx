FHIR Beacon Library
===========

FHIR UI components that provide out-of-the box coverage of elements for all data types and resources AND that
allow composability for supporting extensions as well as varied UI use-cases where only part of the structure
should be shown.

Goals
-----

It's a web component library so that it can be integrated anywhere the web can go:
* client side and server side
* Client rendered frameworks like React and Angular
* server side rendering support
* statically generated sites as well
* use runtime orchestration to make it easy to inject into any existing application (legacy systems, complex apps,
micro-frontends)
* idiomatic and semantic HTML markup
* idiomatic and semantic mapping back to the FHIR model
* support local-first design and good UX by having all the FHIR validation principles executable client-side.
